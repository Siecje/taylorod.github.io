### Project README:

### My static GitHub hosted website - taylorod.github.io

- This is a simple website that lets a viewer get to know me
- It is laid out in a code like style with hidden hyperlinks throughout.
- It's an easy intro page for people who may not want to dive into my blog - www.taylordorsett.com
- It was built by me instead of using Jekyll like www.taylordorsett.com

### Technology stack
 - This website is written in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.
 
### Status
 - This website is copy/content is updated as needed but it's core is finished. 
 
### Getting Started
- You can view it live at taylorod.github.com
- Scroll over some of the text to discover hidden pages
- My blog website, resume, and portfolio can be found near the bottom of the page

## Known issues
- Some may disagree with the code layout ability to actually run
- On mobile the Software Engineer X Technical Recruiter text overlaps with the Taylor Dorsett - 2020 footer

### Contributing
- Feel free to suggest edits or improvements

### TODO
- Add portfolio link when portfolio is finished
- Add more climbing videos once the world opens back up and I can climb again
- Add hotsauce recipes blog link once recipes are finished
- Add podcast recommendation blog link once podcast blog is finished
- Change "reading" link from master list to my blog Book tag link
